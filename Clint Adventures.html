          <h2>Tranquility Cracks</h2>

          <p>Tranquility Cracks refers directly to deep fissures in the rocks above Camps Bay through which one passes, about halfway along the Twelve Apostles. Beyond the cracks is a labyrinth of rocky corridors.There are a number of passages to choose from, all of which offer incredible views. Inside the cracks grow yellowwood trees that have earned the hike the alternative title of Yellowwood Cracks. Here you are sheltered from any wind and sun.</p>

          <h2>RIGHT FACE-ARROW FACE TRAVERSE</h2>

          <p>This route starts at the same place as the Platteklip Gorge trail, but turns right onto the contour path, which you follow until you reach what you think might be Union Cave. Then you go up what you think is Yellowstone Gully, before realising it’s actually Union Ravine (because once again, Alison was doing a terrible job of leading from the back and the point where the path splits off to the right isn’t very clear), so then you have a big debate about whether to keep.</p>

          <h2>Witels</h2>

          <p>Witels is a wonderful Kloofing trip between Worcester and Ceres. The best time of year to do this hike is between November and February. Winter is not recommended though if you like to ski then hiking up to Hoare Hut would be a must. This is a UCT owned hut so book in advance. Permits for Witels can be obtained, as well, from the UCT Mountain Club. It is not for the faint hearted or for those who don't like swimming, as swimming is compulsory at some points during the kloofing trip, so unless you have spiderman powers, and hate swimming, don't do this hike.</p>

          <h2>The Alphen Trail</h2>

          <p>The Alphen Trail is possibly one of the most popular of the green belt walks of the Constantia Valley.The walk can start at either end, but most people park their cars on the bend of Alphen Drive that leads off Constantia Main Road to the Alphen Hotel (a national monument in its own right with beautiful gardens and tea to die for, if you’re looking for somewhere to do ‘high tea’ before or after your walk).The trail winds along the Diep River to the Constantiaberg Mountain and in places allows one to walk on either side of the river, with a number of bridge crossings. It’s a beautiful walk filled with lush grass, trees, beautiful skies and the Le Sueur Meadow on the far end of the walk towards Hohenort.</p>

            <h2>The Rhino</h2>

            <p>The Rhino, with its mixture of dark grey-black and occasionally visible orange rock, will capture the imagination of all who visit. And visit it you must, even if you have no intention of climbing. It really is that interesting to behold; a true marvel of time and geological processes. In a fashion reminiscent of climbing the kitchen counter as a child to get the candy on the top shelf, hop up the counter-like feature to attain the base of The Rhino's massive prow. Use a combination of hooks, pushing, pulling, slapping, and compression to move out towards the tip of this beast. As you approach the end of the prow, move out to climbers right, and top it out. Fear not, your weight on the end won't tip it over. Interestingly, The Rhino is actually quite narrow relative to its length, giving it the appearance of a dagger blade when viewed from certain angles. Remember... you're unlikely to find a more bizarre feature to climb anywhere.</p>
